This is a demo project for my portfolio that i created using the experience i got studying on an iOS development course.

Development of this app was in parallel with a series of online lessons in which i was introduced to Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern as well as implementing some of OOP principles applied.
Also, another important thing was learning to incorporate Objecive-C code into Swift to implement some existing features like animated alerts.
